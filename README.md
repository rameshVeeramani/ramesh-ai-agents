# AI Agents A-Z

https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/ai-agents-a-z/0642572007604)

This course provides a comprehensive guide to understanding, implementing, and managing AI agents both at the prototype stage and in production. Attendees will start with foundational concepts and progressively delve into more advanced topics, including various frameworks like CrewAI, LangChain, and AutoGen as well as building agents from scratch using powerful prompt engineering techniques. The course emphasizes practical application, guiding participants through hands-on exercises to implement and deploy AI agents, evaluate their performance, and iterate on their designs. We will go over key aspects like cost projections, open versus closed source options, and best practices are thoroughly covered to equip attendees with the knowledge to make informed decisions in their AI projects.


## Setup Instructions


### Using Python 3.11 Virtual Environment

At the time of writing, we need a Python virtual environment with Python 3.11.

#### Option 1: Python 3.11 is Already Installed

##### Step 1: Verify Python 3.11 Installation

```bash
python3.11 --version
```

##### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
```

This creates a `.venv` folder in your current directory.

##### Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment

- **macOS/Linux:**
  
  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

- **Windows:**
  
  ```cmd
  .venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

You should see `(.venv)` in your terminal prompt.

##### Step 4: Verify the Python Version

```bash
python --version
```

##### Step 5: Install Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##### Step 6: Deactivate the Virtual Environment

```bash
deactivate
```

---

#### Option 2: Install Python 3.11

If you donâ€™t have Python 3.11, follow the steps below for your OS.

##### **macOS (Using Homebrew)**

```bash
brew install python@3.11
```

##### **Ubuntu/Debian**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.11 python3.11-venv
```

##### **Windows (Using Windows Installer)**

1. Go to [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/).
2. Download the installer for Python 3.11.
3. Run the installer and ensure **"Add Python 3.11 to PATH"** is checked.

### Verify Installation

```bash
python3.11 --version
```

## Notebooks

In the activated environment, run

```bash
python3 -m jupyter notebook
```
